        I co-founded The Bike Lab with my friend and fellow MechE PhD student, Bianca. The group holds weekly office hours where volunteers teach bike repair and maintanence.
        We also host workshops on best practices for safe urban cycling and practical skills for bike commuters. The Bike Lab is a great way to engage with the community and promote
        sustainable transportation. I have been thrilled to see the group grow and to see the impact we have had on the MIT community.

        I have been involved in Habitat for Humanity since high school. This organization helps 
        members of the community achieve their dream of homeownership by using volunteer labor to build affordable housing. 
        I have relished the opportunity to engage with and serve my community in this way while also learning exciting new skills in 
        construction. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to orchestrate and lead a group of my peers in a Habitat build through my position 
        on the community service branch of MIT’s engineering honor society, Tau Beta Pi. While I had hoped to organize more events this 
        year to introduce my peers to the incredibly gratifying experience of contributing to a Habitat build, I am excited to do so whenever such 
        activities can resume safely.

        I was first introduced to the GBFB through a Tau Beta Pi community service event in my sophomore year. I was thrilled to see the impact of our 
        small group’s efforts and was eager to contribute further. It occured to me that the structure of MIT dining and cook-for-yourself systems produced 
        a great deal of food waste - especially at the end of the year when many students and staff relocate for the summer term. Seeing this excess inspired 
        me to organize a food drive, benefitting the GBFB, to help alleviate food insecurity for our neighbors in the Boston area community. As many prepared
        to leave campus for the summer, I gathered a few friends to help distribute collection boxes and donation guidelines. The response was stunning; donation 
        boxes overflowed and we were barely able to fit them all into our van. The food drive has become an annual event, and even this past year I was able to throw 
        together a last minute drive to help sustain the food bank amid the pandemic evacuations and collected a surprising volume of donations (pictured) despite the haste.

        In the summer of 2019 I had a 3 month internship in the BioInstrumentation Lab at the University of Auckland 
        (more about that on my <a href="mind.html#research" onclick="w3_close()">Research Page</a>). On weekends I got to row
        with the Auckland Rowing Club. My new coworkers and rowing friends showed me around the city and taught me so much about 
        kiwi culture! I remember all the confused looks on my first day at the rowing club when they asked what side
        I rowed on and I said "starboard." In New Zealand they say stroke and bow instead of port and starboard. I had great fun learning 
        all the different terms and practices across the pond.

      <p>
        My coworkers in the lab often went out into the city for lunch. I was thrilled to discover that sushi is a common fast-food in Auckland, 
        unlike in the states where it is priced more as a luxury item. I probably tried just about every sushi and poke restaurant in the city! 
        (I HIGHLY recommend Sushi Pac if you find yourself in Auckland)<br>
        I also was fortunate enough to be in New Zealand during the Matariki Festival, a month-long celebration of the Maori New Year. I got to participate in 
        cultural events such as stargazing in the harbor from a traditional "waka" and eating at a "hangi" in the city center.

        For the majority of my trip I lived with about 6 flatmates from various other countries (France, Holland, Japan,...etc). We ate some 
        dinners together and shared stories about our home countries. I was especially fascinated to learn about how different their educational 
        systems where to that of the US. One of my flatmates had a car and so we were able to explore even more of beautiful New Zealand - hiking through farmlands, forests, mountains, and beaches.

        At the end of my internship, I ventured to the south island for some more adventures. I started with a 3 day solo trek through Abel Tasman. Then I headed to Rotorua

    <h4>Big Sur</h4>
    <div class="box w3-container tab">
      <p>The summer of 2020 was a wild one. I was accepted to a selection camp for the U23 US National Rowing Team and so started the summer 
        off with lots of training in the hopes of competing at the World Championships in Slovenia at the end of the summer. As the camp progressed though 
        so did the Covid pandemic and the championships were ultimately cancelled. 
      </p>
      <p> Instead, near the end of the summer, I booked a last minute flight and joined a couple of my friends from the MIT crew team who were WWOOFing in Big Sur, CA. 
        WWOOF stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. It was an adventure for sure. We slept in tents on the roof and during the day we tended the olive 
        trees and gardens, did odd jobs in town, and mostly performed fire prevention work - clearing truckloads of branches, brambles,...and poison oak. In our spare 
        time, I built a multi-purpose squat rack (more details on <a href="hand.html#projects" onclick="w3_close()">Project Page</a>!) and learned to play the ukulele 
        (inspiring my later <a href="hand.html#projects" onclick="w3_close()">ukulele project</a>). We had great fun running up and down the mountainside, snacking on 
        wild huckleberries, and climbing the tallest trees/boulders we could find.

      <p>I stayed longer than my friends, and once they left I helped make a new gate for the top of the mountain. I reveled in the chance to learn new skills like 
        using a jackhammer and welding! At the end of each day we were thoroughly spent, but it was a rewarding feeling. Our fire prevention work also came in handy 
        as wildfires came within about 5 miles during the last week of my stay! WWOOFing was a welcome escape from "normal life" & the pandemic. It also taught me 
        so much - about new tools & techniques, and also about myself as in this lifestyle-shift I found many opportunities for introspection.

        Rome, Brugge, Brussels, Copenhagen, and of course Amsterdam. I also got to spend a week at the company office in Leubeck, Germany

    <h4>Tokyo, Japan</h4>
    <div class="box w3-container tab">
      <p style="display: inline">After the conference in Hong Kong, I hopped on a quick flight to Tokyo to fulfill a childhood dream of exploring the Land of the Rising Sun. 
        My father often took work trips there when I was young and I always wanted to see the country myself but never got a chance to - until now! Granted Tokyo is not representative of the entirety of Japan, but 
        it was a fantastic introduction to the culture and people (and a great appetizer for future trips to other parts of Japan!). I was amazed by the blend of ancient tradition and cutting-edge technology 
        that defines Tokyo. From the serene Shinto and Buddhist shrines to the bustling streets of Shibuya, every corner of the city offered something new and exciting. I indulged in the most mind-blowingly 
        flavorful sushi at Toyosu Market, got an impromptu lesson in traditional Kabuki instruments, and even tried my hand at weilding a katana!
